# espanitario-study-spanish-website
A  Spanish learner website with videos, worksheets, multiple choice grammar and vocabulary quizzest etc.

This website is designed for students of the CSEC Caribbean High School exams or for students of the GCSE exams. It contains great content for Spanish learners such as lesson videos, worksheets, quiz applets for new vocabulary, reading comprehension, grammar practice. It also offers a range of Oral exam practice questions.

It is far from finished however I would like to add a mySQL component to it to track user's top scores at first, then secondly time spent on the website and thirdly and finally a unique page visits counter as a personal intro to web analytics.
